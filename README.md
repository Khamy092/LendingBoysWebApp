# Lending Boys Web Application

## Background:

I was once working with a self-employed mortgage broker who were using a messy excel chart for client information managment. It was too much to handle at some points that I decide to do something about it. Luckily, at the same semester at university, we learned about web applications and database a bit. It was enough to get me started to make this happen.

## About The Application:
The Lending Boys Web Application is a simple and user-friendly platform for managing client information. It allows to easily add, view, edit, and remove customer profiles. Additionally, the application also provides search feature to quickly find customer profiles based on client ID, name, and phone number.

### How it works:

To be updated.

## Tech Stack I Used:
This web application is mainly built on ASP.NET MVC framework. There is no technical reason for choosing this. I guess it was mainly because I was introduced to it at university.

### Front-End:
For the front-end, I used pure html, custom css, and Bootstrap framework which I think a great start point to using frameworks. It is simple, concise and doesn't require a lot of research as you pick the patterns over time. What I didn't like about it was lack of flexibility.

### Back-End:
For the back-end, the Lending Boys Web Application uses C# for database connections, data validation, and other related tasks. While some aspects of the back-end were taken care of by the ASP.NET MVC framework, there were still some complexities involved in building the application.

### Database:
I used MySQL to create the database for the appl. To help with the design, I used UMLet to create a schema. MySQL is a reliable and commonly used relational database management system that was a good fit for the project, and UMLet helped me to visually organize and define the necessary relationships and constraints. The combination of these tools proved effective in creating a functional and well-structured database.

## Tools I Used:
I used Visual Studio as my primary IDE for coding. For the database schema design, I used UMLet, and for database management, I used Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. In addition, I used Github Copilot for code suggestions and auto-generation, and other online resources to help me figure out any issues that arose during development. These tools and resources helped me to develop the application more efficiently and effectively. I would also like to acknowledge that Icon8.com icons are used in the application although I had a premium account and could legally use them without their name.

## Limitations:
The Lending Boys Web Application has no authentication process. This was out of scope for me during development. However, I understand the importance of authentication in maintaining the security and privacy of client information.

The codes were just working during development, but I acknowledge that they need serious review for optimization and maintenance. Additionally, there are security concerns around the SQL queries and general codes that need to be considered. I plan to address these issues in future project where I plan to learn about security aspects of web applications.

I was not able to deploy the application to Microsoft Azure due to the database being out of the free zone. While the main web pages were working, there was no data to show due to this limitation.

Finally, as always, there is room for improvement in any project, especially when building something for learning purposes. I am open to feedback and suggestions to further develope my skills for future projects.

## Challenges I Faced:
I think you can guess it. Back-End ðŸ˜„

But you know what? I loved it. It took me beyond my comfort zone and taught me a lot of new stuff. I kinda see back-end as a huge opportinuty to learn more now. Specially, when the solutions or guides you find do not directly solve your problem which is good. It makes you think and analyse and use existing solutions to solve your unique problem.

Another challenging part was handling null values from the database. There are always there and need to be handled if you don't wanna see a page with red texts. You can use try & catch in C# to handle them like a boss. 


## What I Learned:

AI tools are your friend. If you know the basics, AI helps you go beyond your current skill set. It helps you code, test, and debug errors while teaching you the logic which is nothing less than magic. 

Another lesson I learned was asking for help from someone more experienced. Luckily, I had a Java Developer friend who was a fairly experienced developer who would help see my blindsights and navigate through problems. But do this in a different style. Don't just solve your problem, but the learn why it happend and how to solve it.

Finally, I learned the importance of Github for code managment the hard way. There were instances, that I had a partially working solution for a certain error, but then my new solution would destroy the exisiting solution and it got too complicated and confusing that mostly led to demotivation.

## General Tips:

1. Your IDE is everything. Choose a good one like VSCode or Visual Studio itself.
2. You don't have to know everything. Just stick with the process. 
3. AI, Google, StackoverFlow, and similar tools are your best friend. 
4. It is all a figuring out game. If you leave, you lose.
5. Asking for help is a part of the process and nothing to be worried about it. Most people enjoy helping you.
